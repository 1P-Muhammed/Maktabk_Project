        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>
            We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after
            receiving your item to request a return.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition
            that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original
            packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start a return, you can contact us at
            <a href="mailto:rahhacraft@gmail.com">rahhacraft@gmail.com</a>. Please
            note that returns will need to be sent to the following address:
            [INSERT RETURN ADDRESS].
        </p>
        <p>
            If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as
            well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent
            back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can always contact us for any return question at
            <a href="mailto:rahhacraft@gmail.com">rahhacraft@gmail.com</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Damages and Issues</h2>
        <p>
            Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if
            the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so
            that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
        </p>

        <h2>Exceptions / Non-Returnable Items</h2>
        <p>
            Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such
            as food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders
            or personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty
            products). We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials,
            flammable liquids, or gases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.
        </p>

        <h2>Exchanges</h2>
        <p>
            The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item
            you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase
            for the new item.
        </p>

        <h2>European Union 14 Day Cooling Off Period</h2>
        <p>
            If the merchandise is being shipped into the European Union, you have
            the right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, for any
            reason and without justification. As above, your item must be in the
            same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and
            in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of
            purchase.
        </p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>
            We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and
            let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
            automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10
            business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or
            credit card company to process and post the refund too.
        </p>
        <p>
            If more than 15 business days have passed since we’ve approved your
            return, please contact us at
            <a href="mailto:rahhacraft@gmail.com">rahhacraft@gmail.com</a>.
